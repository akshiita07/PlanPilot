# PlanPilot
To-do list web application built with Express.js, PostgreSQL, and EJS templating. Users can add, edit, and delete tasks. It interfaces with a PostgreSQL database to store and retrieve tasks, rendering them dynamically on the front-end using EJS. The server handles CRUD operations via specific routes and uses body-parser to process incoming data.
